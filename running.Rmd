One of the great joys in my life is running with friends! I have a wonderful group of fellow runners who all gather on weekend (and occassional early weekday) mornings for a run that either ends at the Ithaca Farmer's Market, or someone's house for a potluck brunch. You can check out our favorite routes on my Strava, and take a peek at the action with some of the pics below!
